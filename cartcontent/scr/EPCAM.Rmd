<h4>Description</h4>
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule ([EPCAM](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P16422)). May act as a physical homophilic interaction molecule between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) at the mucosal epithelium for providing immunological barrier as a first line of defense against mucosal infection. Plays a role in embryonic stem cells proliferation and differentiation. Up-regulates the expression of FABP5, MYC and cyclins A and E.

<h4>Target gene expression</h4>
The following plot describes the expression, in different tissues and TCGA cancers, of the different isoforms of the gene EPCAM.
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = F, fig.width = 32, fig.height= 20}
setwd("../../")
boxplot_isoforms_all_tissues(hgnc = "EPCAM") # it creates the boxplot in the html and saves it as .pdf in the plot/isoform_expression folder
```

<br>

<h4>Target essentiality</h4>
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = F, fig.width = 25, fig.height= 12}
setwd("../../")
target_essentiality_fun(gene_name_hgnc = "EPCAM") # it creates the boxplot in the html and saves it as .pdf in the plot/target_essentiality folder
```

<h4>Protein properties</h4>
The following plot describes the target topology, highlighting the position of the endo-, ecto- and transmembrane domains, as well as the position of a signal peptide, when present. 
The last three rows describe the position of potential epitopes, as well as phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. 
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height= 4}
setwd("../../")
plot_function("EPCAM") # it creates the plot in the html and saves it as .pdf in the plot/protein_properties folder
```
