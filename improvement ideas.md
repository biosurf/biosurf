### Data scientist's wiki:
* Link for raw code for dat scientist’s primer needs an update (it has been removed for now).
* 3D + interactive plot embeddings dont work: {“type”:“data”, “dataset”:“59afbf1da6b06402ace2194d”, “subset”:“null”}, {“type”:“data”, “dataset”:“59afc3b6a6b06402ace2194e”, “subset”:“null”}
* Add clustree to data scientist’s primer
* Make nicer tables
* Make nicer FlowSOM MST
* Another example of spillover is in Mike's FlowRepository files, where the Dead-mid population is 115 spillover from the CD57-In113 channel.
* Expand on batch correction?
* Add an uncleaned dimred plot


### Cytometrist's primer:
* Under citrus: "Since the clustering is hierarchical, one should be aware that the clusters are not mutually exclusive and some cells will be present in more than one cluster. The central cluster (Number 1 on the figure below) contains all cells, Cluster 2 contains a subset of the cells in cluster 1, cluster 3 contains a subset of the cells in cluster 2, etc."
- Is there a figure missing there?  I don't see any node labelings.  I seem to recall a nice "nested" set of circles in the previous version of Biosurf, which more clearly explained the point.....
